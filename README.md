#### _My motto: Observe. Listen. Think. Learn._

#### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

### Vision Statement
I believe one day we all can digitally communicate with each other with a better connection while being mindful of our differences in opinion. A cooperative and collaborative digital society based on the grounds of decentralisation for co-existance and prosperity.


### Mission Statement
Todayâ€™s technology holds the beauty of bringing seamless impact going unnoticed while its meaningful contribution greatly influences our daily lives. I see a promise in it to offer a communication framework enabling an effortless and collaborative environment for the global society to interact. It is my mission to make this happen.
